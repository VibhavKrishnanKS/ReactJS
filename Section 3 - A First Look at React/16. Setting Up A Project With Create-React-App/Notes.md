# 16. Setting Up A Project with Create-React-App

1. **Create-React-App** - This is a **Command Line Interface** tool
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your React App
> npx create-react-app {your name of the application}  
> Example - npx create-react-app pizza menu 
3. If suppose say i want to use a specific version of react 
> npx create-react-app@{version number} {your name of the application}    
> Example - npx create-react-app@5 pizza menu
> This will lock in version 5 of the react application
4. Once after the react application is created  
  1.1. We have **package.json** - which contains 
    * The name of the Application
    * Version
    * Dependency Scripts
5. **node_modules** - This contains all the packages that are required for our application to run. This has the
  * React package
  * React DOM package
